/**
 * Specifies that a persistent property or field should be persisted 
 * as a large object to a database-supported large object type. 
 * The <code>Lob</code> annotation may be used in conjunction 
 * with the {@link Basic} annotation. A <code>Lob</code> may be 
 * either a binary or character type. 
 *
 * <p> The <code>Lob</code> type is inferred from the type of the 
 * persistent field or property, and except for string and 
 * character-based types defaults to Blob.
 * <pre>
 *
 *   Example:
 *
 *   &#064;Lob &#064;Basic(fetch=LAZY)
 *   &#064;Column(name="REPORT")
 *   protected String report;
 * </pre>
