/**
 * This annotation is used to specify a secondary table for 
 * the annotated entity class. Specifying one or more secondary 
 * tables indicates that the data for the entity class is stored 
 * across multiple tables.
 *
 * <p> If no <code>SecondaryTable</code> annotation is specified, 
 * it is assumed that all persistent fields or properties of the 
 * entity are mapped to the primary table. If no primary key join 
 * columns are specified, the join columns are assumed to reference 
 * the primary key columns of the primary table, and have the same 
 * names and types as the referenced primary key columns of the 
 * primary table.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example 1: Single secondary table with a single primary key column.
 *
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    &#064;Table(name="CUSTOMER")
 *    &#064;SecondaryTable(name="CUST_DETAIL", 
 *        pkJoinColumns=&#064;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="CUST_ID"))
 *    public class Customer { ... } 
 *
 *    Example 2: Single secondary table with multiple primary key columns.
 *
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    &#064;Table(name="CUSTOMER")
 *    &#064;SecondaryTable(name="CUST_DETAIL",
 *        pkJoinColumns={
 *            &#064;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="CUST_ID"),
 *            &#064;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="CUST_TYPE")})
